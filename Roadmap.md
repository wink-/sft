# SFTSYS
## DMR/CAR
An internal or external rejection to discrepant material ( work we performed) needs to be documented and in doing so value needs to be added to the data.

### Models
What models do I need to make the DMR/CAR system work?
* DMRS
* Workorder
* Process
* CARS
* Customers
* Employees
* LaborCard
* Parts

## Where to start?
What relationships are there going to be?
> DMR belongs to one Workorder, Workorders can have many DMRs

> Workorder belongs to one Part, Parts can have many Workorders

> Part belongs to Customer, Customer has many Parts

> Part belongs to Process, Processes has many Parts 

So start with Process and Customer first.

### Customer
What is the workflow to be done to create a customer?

>Create Model
* Add fillable fields -- **protected $fillable = [foo, bar, biz, baz];**
* Change the table to which the model corresponds -- **protected $table = 'mysql_tbl_name';**
* Turn on softDeletes if used -- **use SoftDeletes;** 
* Don't forget to import use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletes;
* If using SoftDeletes, set protected **$dates = ['deleted_at'];**
* Define any relationships belongsTo, hasMany, etc.


>Create Controller

>Create Route

>Create Views - index, show, and create and form.

>Create migration and seeds











### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Marked] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
